  <h1>About Nick</h1>
  <p>I will receive my Bachelor of Science in Computer Networking and Cybersecurity in May 2021. I'm really passionate about what I do at Champlain and am currently involved with the Digital Forensics Association Club. My coursework and internship experience has helped me to develop effective Creative Thinking, Leadership and Management, Problem Solving and a passion for technology.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p><strong>Creative Thinking: </strong><br>
  I value the opportunity to bring my wit, humor, and curious nature to support others and contribute to the creative design and completion of projects.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p><strong>Leadership and Management:</strong><br> Whether working independently or as part of a group, I seek to carry out an idea to completion efficiently and effectively. I think our strongest leaders are those who operate from a place of service and support to others.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p><strong>Problem Solving:</strong><br> When I see a challenge, I aim to clarify the nature of the problem, evaluate alternatives, and propose a variety of potential solutions. I am seen as someone who can generate workable solutions, resolve complaints, and overcome challenges creatively.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>In the next chapter of my career, I aspire to practice and contribute these skills while being of service to an innovative and high performing team.
