  <h1>Nick's Example Website</h1>

  <h2>Topic Idea:</h2>
  <p>This capstone will produce a console tool written in Python3 to aid in the exploitation of websites. This tool's primary purpose is to help assist capture the flag players solve challenges, and perhaps assist penetration testers to exploit very vulnerable websites. As of September 6th, 2020, the tool is projected to have a login cracker, cookie manipulator, dictionary and file identifier, and a web proxy that will allow you to manipulate requests.
  </p>

  <h2>Overview:</h2>
  <p>I've had an interest in web application security for my entire college career. During my sophomore year, I competed in a capture the flag called picoCTF. During the competition, I made scripts to automate getting all of the flags to help me understand later down the line how I solved each challenge. I tried automating a web challenge in python, and I ended up with a cookie manipulation tool. I told myself I would turn that tool into a fully functional web exploitation tool, and I never got around to it. So now, I'm using this capstone as an excuse to get it done.
  </p>

  <h2>Description of the process:</h2>
  <p>I will need to plan out, research, and program my tool in Python3. In order to test out all of the functionality of the tool, I will need to also create a vulnerable website to test every part of the tool. I would also be able to use that target site to create a demo. Since I need to create a very weak website, I will be creating it myself. This will entail all of the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL, and any other web-based technologies I need to add.
